# Hi!👋 Welcome to my GitHub 😁
## 👀 Know me better
I'm changed my professional development path to be Software Tester. I always care about high quality of performimg tasks and develop my skills.🚀 During my training process I have learned and mastered writing test cases, reporting defects and creating test reports, black and white-box testing, exploratory testing, testing of websites and mobile applications, REST API testing.
I know how to use SQL, Chrome DevTools, Jira, Postman, GIT, JSON, HTML/CSS basics and more.

To expand my testing skills I am currently focusing on cybersecurity. From over month I'm taking lessons/rooms on Try Hack Me platform and since 26th of August I've started "OTWA" course (Offensive Web Application Testing), which I am very excited about 😁
